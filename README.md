Arduino codes, schematics of the following projects:
- powerMeter_apr25b:  portable power meter using INA219 current sensor, powered by Lithium batter and loging data to SD card (Credit to GreatScott Lab)
- powermeter_may18a: v2: power meter using INA219 and 18B20 temperature probe, Nokia 5110 screen, and log data to a computer via Serial communication by a python script 
- powermeter_may10d: v2.1: tools for LED evaluation: based v2 power meter, added TLS2561 luminosity sensor and photocell, log data via Serial by python script
- dimmerPir_May16d: control 4x3W LED by motiion sensor or  with MQTT with Json format, intensity is parsed out by the controller, or it can be turned on by a switch, using ESP8266 -01
- simpleControl_mar28: a simple NTP clock with a terminal to publish analog reading to MQTT server, can be 4 seperated channel.
